## Project Overview

. The purpose of this project was to develop source codes which will be used for scraping data using different python modules
 
· The tools/modules used for this analysis include the following:
         o   Python | Markdown | HTML | CSS
         o   BS (Beautiful soup) | Splinter | ChromeDriver | Pandas | Flask
         o   Jupyter NB | MongoDB | Pymongo
 
·  A total of 5 websites was visited for the purpose of web scraping in this project
         o   Mars Latest News: https://mars.nasa.gov/news
         o   JPL Mars Space Images: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/
         o   Mars Weather: https://twitter.com/marswxreport
         o   Mars Facts: https://space-facts.com/mars/
         o   Mars Hemispheres:  https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
 
·   Codes from jupyter notebook categorized as a dictionary, exported & captured in a python file as scrape.py
 
·   Established connection with MongoDB using pymongo
 
·   Created flask/HTML template that contains scraped format
 
 
### Challenges
 
·    Experienced a lot of errors.
 
·    Experienced a lot of delays with the websites loading or not loading at all probably due to internet connections & this also caused      a lot of missing data when loading.
